# Converto-Image-Stringifier
While I was procrastinating, I decided to draw my own image using letters. So, the aim of converto is to take images and redraw them with ASCII characters.

## How to use
* type the following in yout terminal with replacing:<br />
        - ```YourImgPath)``` with your image path<br />
        - ```f_value``` with the desired fringe value (defualt=10)<br />
        - ```dg_value``` with the desired downgrade value (defualt=8)<br />
     <br />
 ```$(python main.py --input_path "YourImgPath" --fringe f_value --downgrade_factor dg_value) ```
